)F FUNCTION -

    DATECALC is a REXX function that allows you find the difference
    between two dates, add or subtract a time period from a date, or
    convert a given date to another format.  You can also have the
    output in some additional formats, and get U.S. Holidays for the
    month or year.

    The output and date input can be in any format supported by the
    REXX DATE function, so date conversion from one form to another is
    allowed.  Non-IBM REXX date formats are supported for input and
    output, and holidays can be requested for a month or a year.

)X SYNTAX -
    To add or subtract a time period from a date;

    x = DATECALC(Output,Date,-/+ m/d/y,Alt_output)

    To find the difference between two dates;

    x = DATECALC(Output,Date1,Date2,Alt_output)

 ALIASES  - none.
 DEFAULTS - none.
 REQUIRED - Date/+-m/d/y or Date1/Date2.

)O OPERANDS -

))Output -
            One, or more, of the valid REXX DATE options.  If more than
            one is given the output is the result of appending, with a
            comma between each form of the answer.  If you only want
            the alt_output, you can code '.' as a place holder for
            output.

))Date  -
))Date1
))Date2     A date in the format d/m/y.  Defaults to DATE('U').  You
            may preface the date with any of the valid REXX DATE
            options to indicate type of input.

            i.e. b89234 indicates the input date is in base format.

            Besides the REXX DATE options, you can use I for ISO format
            (yyyy-mm-dd) and O for Oracle (dd-mmm-yy)

))Operation -
            Either "+" or "-".  When used as a function the third
            argument should have the format '+/- m/d/y', as in
            '+ 3/23/0'.  When a + or - is not specified, then it is
            assumed that the second and third arguments are dates.

))m/d/y     -
            A time span.  Mm, dd, or yy can be 0-9999

))Alt_output-
            This output will be appended to any of the first form
            output with a semi-colon between them.  As with the first
            form output, each form of the answer will have a comma
            between them.

    D     -
            Days between dates. This form will span years, unlike the
            primary D format (which conforms to the EDATE format).

    HM    -
            Holidays in the given month.  Returns None if there are no
            holidays.

            For example,

            x = DATECALC(.,11/1/1190,.,HM) would return
            Veteran's Day - 11/11/1990 on 11/12/1990,
            Thanksgiving Day - 11/22/1990

    HY    -
            Holidays in the given year.  Returns the name of the
            holiday, followed by a '-', followed by the date of the
            holiday and the date the holiday is taken if it fell on a
            Saturday or Sunday.

    ISO   -
            ISO format, yyyy-mm-dd

    L     -
            Years will not be truncated to 2 digits. If you don't
            specify L, x = DATECALC(U,8/25/1957) comes out as 8/25/57.
            If you do specify L, it comes out as 8/25/1957.

    LEAPS -
            Leap years in answer

    ORACLE-
            ORACLE format, dd-mmm-yy

    M     -
            Days in month of date1

    W     -
            Weeks in result

    WY    -
            Week of Year

    Q     -
            Quarter of Year ( Jan-Feb, .....)

)NOTES -
1.  Date1 should always be the larger of the two numbers when doing
    subtraction or a difference.

2.  The third argument, when the operation is -/+, is not checked for
    the regular date conformance.  Any value can be passed, so 13// or
    /45/ would be valid.

3.  When doing a date +/- a time period it hardly pays to ask for the
    output in formats like M, J, etc.  Also, if you add a time period
    to a date, it does not follow that you can subtract the same time
    period from the result and get the starting date.  For example;

    x = DATECALC(S,1/29/1990,-11/1) = 19890228

    but,

    x = DATECALC(S,2/28/1989,+11/1) = 19900201

4.  When doing date differences DATECALC first figures out how many
    months and days remain in the second date, then adds these to the
    full months, days and years of the first date.  The result is then
    'fixed' (months > 12, days greater than days in results month).

5.  When doing a date minus a time period DATECALC first subtract the
    month/s, day/s, and year/s of the time period from the date.  The
    result is then 'fixed' (months < 12, days < 1)

6.  When doing a date plus a time period DATECALC first addes the
    month/s, day/s, and year/s of the time period from the date.  The
    result is then 'fixed' (months > 12, days greater than days in
    results month).

7.  In 4, 5, and 6 leap year is taken into consideration.

)ERRORS
    RC = 1 = invalid output option
    RC = 2 = invalid date1
    RC = 3 = invalid operation
    RC = 4 = invalid date2 or m/d/y not numeric
